Q1: Create a Car class with the following properties:
    make (String)
    model (String)
    year (int)

Then create a Main class and instantiate two Car objects.
Set their properties using a constructor and print out their details.

//
public class Car {
    public String make;
    public String model;
    public int year;

    public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Car: year + " " + model + " " + model);
    }
 }

 public class Main() {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020);
        Car car2 = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2021);

        car1.displayInfo();
        car2.displayInfo();
    }
}
