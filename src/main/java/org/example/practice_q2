Q2: Write a class Book that contains:
    A title (String)
    An author (String)
    A method displayInfo() that prints out the book's title and author.
Create two Book objects and call the displayInfo() method on both.

public class Book {
    public String title;
    public String author;

    public Book(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }

    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Title" + " " + title + " " + "Author: " + author);
    }

public class Main() {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    Book book1 = new Book("Cat in the hat", "Dr.Seuss");
    Book book2 = new Book("Harry Potter", "JK Rowling");

    book1.displayInfo();
    book2.displayInfo();

        }
   }
