Q3: Write a class Student with the following fields:
    name (String)
    age (int)
    grade (double)
    Write a constructor to initialize these fields.

Add a method getDetails() that prints the student's name, age, and grade.
In the Main class, create an array of 3 Student objects and print the details of each student.

class Student {
    String name;
    int age;
    double grade;

    // Constructor
    public Student(String name, int age, double grade) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.grade = grade;
    }

    // Method to display student details
    public void getDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age + ", Grade: " + grade);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student[] students = new Student[3];
        students[0] = new Student("Alice", 20, 85.5);
        students[1] = new Student("Bob", 21, 90.0);
        students[2] = new Student("Charlie", 22, 88.0);

        for (Student student : students) {
            student.getDetails();
        }
    }
}
